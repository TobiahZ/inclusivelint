# Inclusive Linter

As developers, weâ€™re continually writing code, and we do that by passing messages. Each message carries a lot of context and semantics so we're always evolving how to do it in a better way. Terminology is in the roots of communication, and therefore is as vital for writing quality code as writing User Stories, documentation, and even naming branches. If you care a lot about communicating effectively, I think we must use an **inclusive language** to do so.

The `inclusivelint` enables a more inclusive language and diverse culture through Git workflows.

## Getting Started

```sh
./inclusivelint <your-project-path>
```
